This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: handling incompatible data types in arithmetic operations. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to calculate the average of a list containing both integers and strings. This leads to a `TypeError`. The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected code, which handles this scenario gracefully using error handling or type checking.
